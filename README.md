# Harvard-Machine-Learning-Assignments

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning assignments from my class on the topic. 
The assignments cover a variety of topics, including classification, regression analysis, ensemble methods, web scraping, and linear algebra.

The assignments are organized into folders by topic, and each assignment includes the relevant data and code. 
The code is written in Python, using popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

I obtained an A in this class, and I believe that these assignments showcase my knowledge and abilities in the field of machine learning. 
I hope that these assignments will be useful for anyone looking to learn more about these topics or to see examples of machine learning code in action.
